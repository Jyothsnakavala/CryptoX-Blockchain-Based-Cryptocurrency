# CryptoX-Blockchain Based Cryptocurrency
Created a decentralized, secure currency used for payments  and investments. Tools/Technologies â€“ Solidity, MetaMask, Remix IDE
ABSTRACT
CryptoX is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that operates independently of a central bank 
or government. It uses advanced cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation 
of new units, ensuring decentralization, security, privacy, and global accessibility. The 
blockchain technology enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions, making it 
virtually impossible for anyone to hack or steal funds. CryptoX is created through a process 
called mining, and once created, it can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. As 
blockchain technology evolves, we can expect to see even more innovative use cases for 
CryptoX and other cryptocurrencies.
Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to the growing ecosystem of decentralized digital
currencies, and to create a currency that has the potential to transform the way we think about
money and finance. Additionally, the potential use cases and impact of the new currency on 
the financialsystem will be explored.
INTRODUCTION
This project involves building a new cryptocurrency using blockchain technology. The goal is 
to create a decentralized, secure, and efficient currency that can be used for various purposes 
such as payments and investments. A user-friendly wallet will also be created to enable users 
to send and receive the new currency. Scalability and compliance with relevant regulations will 
be key considerations throughout the project. 
The cryptocurrency world may seem daunting to the average investor, especially for those 
without technical knowledge of blockchain and smart contracts. However, the prospects of 
many new digital currencies have drawn in all types of investors, including those who might 
have otherwise been cautious about investing in a digital token or cryptocurrency.
While investors can certainly be successful in the cryptocurrency space without having underthe-hood technical knowledge, a basic understanding of some of the most important properties 
of many of the current digital currencies is undoubtedly helpful in guiding an investor toward 
the safest and soundest financial decisions. One of the major concepts that govern a large 
portion of the space, and which is especially relevant to smart contracts and smart property, is 
what is known as the ERC20 token standard.
"ERC20" refers to a scripting standard used within the Ethereum blockchain. This technical 
standard dictates several rules and actions that an Ethereum token or smart contract must 
follow and steps to be able to implement it. It is perhaps easiest to think of ERC20 as a set of 
basic guidelines and functions that any new token created in the Ethereum network must 
follow.
